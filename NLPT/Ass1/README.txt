This package contains three code blocks connected to the first assignment of the course Natural Language Processing Techniques

The Assignment explores the fitting of a pre trained BERT model to detect three types of irony through dataset containing English written tweets.

The goals is to classify tweets with, giving them the correct label.

For reproducing the experiments it is recommended to work it google collaboration and use google' GPU power. Also, the text files in the code could refer to drive directories, but ca easily be changed to normal local saved .txt files.


The codes for parts A, B and C have to be run in the same folder as the data sets they work with (as well as prediction set).
The exercises can be commented at the end of the files to not appear on the run.
