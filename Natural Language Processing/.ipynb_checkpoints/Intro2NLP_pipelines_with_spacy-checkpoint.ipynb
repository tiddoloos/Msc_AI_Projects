    "This notebook is based on an earlier version developed by Piek Vossen and Selene Baez. The [original version](https://github.com/cltl/ma-hlt-labs/blame/master/lab1.toolkits/Lab1.3-introduction-to-spaCy.ipynb) is more detailed and might be helpful if you have limited programming experience.\n",

    "[SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) combines multiple natural language processing analyses in a single Pythin package: it takes a raw document and can perform tokenization, POS-tagging, stop word recognition, morphological analysis, lemmatization, sentence splitting, dependency parsing and Named Entity Recognition (NER). The advantage of spaCy is that it is really fast, and it has a good accuracy. In addition, it currently supports multiple languages, among which: English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Dutch. Other popular Python packages are [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) and [stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show you the basic usage of spaCy. Please additionally check the [user guides](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features) and the documentation of the [models](https://spacy.io/models) for details.  \n"

    "To install spaCy, check out the instructions [here](https://spacy.io/usage). On this page, it is explained exactly how to install spaCy for your operating system, package manager and desired languages. Simply run the suggested commands in your terminal ([Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) or cmd). In this notebook, we are going to download the English language resources. The standard download command from the command line is the following:"
