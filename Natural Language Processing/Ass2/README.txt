README

Authors: Tiddo Loos

This folder contains datasets (CSV) of parsed sentences , output parser files (CSV) and two phython (.py) scripts. The photon script ran code to perform tests and output results for assignment 2 of NLPT.

Python files require Pyhton3.
partB.py uses 'conllst.2017.trial.simple.conll' as input.
partB.py must be run firstly.
The output file ('CoNLL_Table.csv') that partB.py produces is used in partC.py.

File partD.py can be run as it is (with Python3).
